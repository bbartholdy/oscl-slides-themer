An important goal is to practice science in a transparent way. 

Open science topics include: 

- transparent methods
- pre-registration
- sharing data/code and research tools
- reproducibility
- replication research
- citizen science
- open peer-review
- publishing .oa[open access] `r emo::ji("unlock")`
- diversity and inclusion
- research integrity
- uploading preprints and (meta) research about scientific methods

## The How

---
class: center, middle

Embarking on Open Science can seem rather daunting at first: there are so many new terms and all sorts of different organisations committed to Open Science. 

The <b>Open Science Community Leiden</b> wants to make the new developments accessible to everyone, in an efficient manner. 

We will organise events such as workshops or talks, including drinks, so you can get to know each other and find out who to ask. You can also take a look at the [member profiles](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden/members/fsw). 

With experiences harvested at these events, we actively inform top down policy makers, to ensure we co-create the open future together.
